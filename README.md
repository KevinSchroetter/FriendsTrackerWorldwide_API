# FriendsTrackerWorldwide_API
This is an API that can store and send geo-location related data in a mongoDB database using JSON. It is primarily used in a Project called "FriendsTrackerWorldwide" which is going to be an android mobile app.

There is no documentation found in this repository, hence this API is supposed to be used only in a study related context.
However, you are free to download it and try it out. But i would suggest to create your own mongoDB database with mlab.com
instead of using the one connected right now.
