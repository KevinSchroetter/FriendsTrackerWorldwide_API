# FriendsTrackerWorldwide_API
This is an API that can store and send geo-location related data in a mongoDB database using JSON. It is primarily used in a Project called "FriendsTrackerWorldwide" which is going to be an android mobile app.

There is no documentation found in this repository, hence this API is supposed to be used only in a study related context.
However, you are free to download it and try it out. But i would suggest to create your own mongoDB database with mlab.com instead of using the one connected right now.

To use the server, you need to have node installed on your computer.
If you have it, just type the "npm install" command in the console to install 
all needed node modules and after that you can start the node server with "npm start".
